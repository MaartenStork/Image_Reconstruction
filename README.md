# Image Reconstruction Techniques Repository

Welcome to the **Image Reconstruction Techniques Repository**! This repository explores various methods for reconstructing images, each with unique approaches and underlying principles. The goal is to provide an educational and comparative look at several prominent reconstruction methods in the field of image processing, signal analysis, and machine learning.

## Overview

This repository currently includes four different image reconstruction techniques, each demonstrating a distinct approach to reconstructing images from different data representations:

1. **Fourier Transform Reconstruction**
2. **Wavelet Transform Reconstruction**
3. **Compressed Sensing Reconstruction**
4. **Autoencoder-Based Reconstruction (Neural Network)**

These methods have been chosen to represent a variety of philosophies and techniques used in image reconstruction, ranging from traditional frequency analysis to modern machine learning-based techniques.

## Reconstruction Methods

### 1. Fourier Transform Reconstruction
- **Description**: This method uses the **Fourier Transform** to break down an image into its frequency components. The reconstruction process involves sequentially adding back the frequency components, starting from the most significant.
- **Key Learning**: This technique demonstrates how images can be represented in the **frequency domain**, highlighting the importance of different frequency components.
- **Use Case**: Useful for understanding how frequency content contributes to image formation and how compression techniques like JPEG work.

### 2. Wavelet Transform Reconstruction
- **Description**: Unlike the Fourier Transform, the **Wavelet Transform** allows for both frequency and spatial localization. This method decomposes an image using wavelets, which helps preserve details like edges during reconstruction.
- **Key Learning**: Wavelets provide a **multi-resolution analysis**, making them effective for reconstructing both fine and coarse details.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for applications where detail preservation is crucial, such as medical imaging and image compression.

### 3. Compressed Sensing Reconstruction
- **Description**: **Compressed Sensing** is an optimization-based technique that reconstructs images from incomplete or sparse data by exploiting sparsity. It uses optimization algorithms to solve the underdetermined problem of image recovery.
- **Key Learning**: Compressed sensing demonstrates how it is possible to reconstruct images with significantly fewer samples than traditional methods, leveraging the idea of **sparsity**.
- **Use Case**: Widely used in **MRI** and other medical imaging techniques where data acquisition is costly or time-consuming.

### 4. Autoencoder-Based Reconstruction (Neural Network)
- **Description**: This method employs a simple **autoencoder neural network** to learn a compressed representation of an image and then reconstruct it. Autoencoders use a non-linear embedding to learn efficient data representations.
- **Key Learning**: Highlights the power of **deep learning** in reconstructing images by learning latent features, showcasing a data-driven approach.
- **Use Case**: Relevant for applications like **image denoising**, **compression**, and **enhancement**.
